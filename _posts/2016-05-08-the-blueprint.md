Project S.T.E.A.M.B.O.A.T. is making waves by searching through the community for allies. I've had the fortunate virtual introduction with the members of the Culver City School Board, who can assist in making this Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics program a reality. I've also reached out to a few local city council members to form an alliance. 

As I continue to make progress, I am constantly refining the presentation and pitch.
