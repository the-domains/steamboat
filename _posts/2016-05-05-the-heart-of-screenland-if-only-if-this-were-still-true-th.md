The Heart of Screenland. If only if this were still true. The world has deeply moved into the Silicon Age. While Culver City is home to shooting passive moving image entertainment, it is not the home of interactive moving image entertainment. Video games have a stronghold on the screens in this century. We have more screens from small to huge. 

Our eyes are always fixed on a screen. However, what is on the screen? The small screens held in a single hand or the medium sized screens held by both hands usually showcase social network apps and games. As the movie and television screens start to become less relevant, the heart of screenland begins to shrink. Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, HBO Go, Showtime Go, Crunchyroll, and the latest video streaming app to watch movies of yesteryear or the latest episode of our favorite sitcom. The true star of streaming media are the apps. They are the kings and queens that control the content. 

Culver City needs to reclaim the screen by being the newest city to deliver the best interactive entertainment for screens of all sizes including the virtual screens strapped to our eyes.
