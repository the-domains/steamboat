bu\*oy (ˈbo͞oē, boi) noun. - an anchored float serving as a navigation mark, to show reefs or other hazards, or for mooring. 

The Buoys are a status updates for Project S.T.E.A.M. BOAT. They necessarily do not represent milestone; however, some milestones will be Buoys. Project S.T.E.A.M. BOAT seeks transparency for communities interested in starting school and community based school STEAM projects. Our goal is to be the blueprint, and what we call "the penguin" in the gaming community. The penguins are software and apps that trail blaze with inventive ideas.  
Project S.T.E.A.M BOAT is planning to teach the students through Art. Art combines various major and minor contributions to tell a story. Our Arts are representations of us. They are snapshots of our culture and technologies. They are buoys to life. As a result, we are marking the development of our culture with buoys.
