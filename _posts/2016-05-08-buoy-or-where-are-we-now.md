bu\*oy (ˈbo͞oē, boi) noun. - an anchored float serving as a navigation mark, to show reefs or other hazards, or for mooring. 

The Buoys are a status updates for Project S.T.E.A.M. BOAT. They necessarily do not represent milestone; however, some milestones will be Buoys. Project S.T.E.A.M. BOAT seeks transparency for communities interested in starting school and community based school STEAM projects. Our goal is to be the blueprint, and what we call "the penguin" in the gaming community. The penguins are software and apps that trail blaze with inventive ideas.  
Project S.T.E.A.M BOAT is planning to teach the students through Art. Art combines various major and minor contributions to tell a story. Our Arts are representations of us. They are snapshots of our culture and technologies. They are buoys to life. As a result, we are marking the development of our culture with buoys.  
Where are we now?

**Theory of Change**

* I'm currently in S.T.E.A.M. BOAT's [Ideation ][0]stage.
* While ideating, I'm reaching out to the major players in Culver City politics and Culver City School System. _I'm trying to learn who is who, and what is what._
* Submit my proposal to Culver City's Superintendent of Schools and the School Board.
* Submit my proposal to the city council.
* Start working with third party organizations on contributing to the project. 
* Streamline and distill the proposal so it can be repurposed and/or reproduced in other locations.
* Run the Summer program in 2017\.

**Smart Goals**

**Specific **- The goal is to get the city council and the school board interested in steering the students to STEAM industries. I want to create a program that is rigoriously vetted against the current programs, and successfully satisfies the current and future curriculum needs created by the Assistant Superintendent of Education Services, Dr. Kati Krumpe. 

The goal is to receive the School Board approval prior to presenting the extensive nature of the program to the City Council for support. 

**Measurable - **The program is measured by scope, time, and budget. 

* The first measure is getting the scope approved by the Culver City Unified School District -- spring break program --\> summer school program --\> after school program --\> extended learning program.
* The second measure is creating a production schedule based on phases: pre-production, production, alpha, beta, and launch. Make sure that each phase is filled with measurable milestones, manpower, other resources, and definitive budget.

Attainable - Get Project S.T.E.A.M. BOAT approved for concept staging and pre-production.

Realistic - We can get approved to develop a STEAM curriculum that aligns with CCUSD's school requirements. We may also be able to run a pilot program (vertical slice) to measure the aptitude of the students.

Timely - I want to actually run the first program for Culver City Unified School District's Spring Break 2017\.
